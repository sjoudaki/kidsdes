# KiDS+DES

We are releasing the central chains for the combined analysis of KiDS+VIKING-450 and Dark Energy Survey Year 1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09262.

i) kv450 refers to KiDS+VIKING-450 (KV450).

ii) desy1_orignz refers to Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES-Y1) with KiDS analysis setup and original redshift distributions.

iii) desy1 refers to DES-Y1 with KiDS analysis setup and spectroscopic calibration of the redshift distributions.

iv) kv450desy1 refers to the combined analysis of KV450 and DES-Y1 considering a KiDS analysis setup and spectroscopic calibration of the redshift distributions.

We will soon also release the likelihood code for this analysis.

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any questions.

# KiDS + DES

We are releasing the central chains for the combined analysis of the Kilo Degree Survey + VISTA Kilo Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450, or KV450) and Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES-Y1) in https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09262.

i) kv450 refers to KiDS+VIKING-450 (KV450).

ii) desy1_orignz refers to Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES-Y1) with KiDS analysis setup and original redshift distributions.

iii) desy1 refers to DES-Y1 with KiDS analysis setup and spectroscopic calibration of the redshift distributions.

iv) kv450desy1 refers to the combined analysis of KV450 and DES-Y1 considering a KiDS analysis setup and spectroscopic calibration of the redshift distributions.

We also release the likelihood code for this analysis (which is a KiDS + DES version of [CosmoLSS](https://github.com/sjoudaki/CosmoLSS)). This is provided in a single tarball (kv450desy1like.tar.gz) and includes a separate readme on the code and data products.

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@ciemat.es if you have any questions.
